# Advanced Java Development
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course Advanced Java Development. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
All of the code needed for this course is on the main branch. 

The package names correspond to the videos in this course. The naming convention is _CHAPTER#_MOVIE#. As an example, the package named _02_03 corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.

Some code examples will have a before and an end state. In this case the package will contain two more directories, `before` and `end`. The `before` directory will contain the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `end` directory contains the code as it is at the end of the movie.


## Installing
1. To use these exercise files, you must have Java 8 or higher installed.
2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like SourceTree.
3. Open the code in your favorite IDE.
